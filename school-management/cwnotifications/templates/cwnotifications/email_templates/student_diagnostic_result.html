  Thank you for taking the time to take our diagnostic exams. A couple of notes
  to take with your score report:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If you have signed up for taking both the SAT &amp; ACT, your first report
    will contain just a detailed score report, and your second report will
    contain the score report plus recommendations.

    report &amp; recommendations.

  Once you have report with the recommendations it will contain a mapping of
  your answers alongside the correct answer for each question followed by a
