Complete this spreadsheet for each school that offers/requires the admissions interview.</p>\r\n<p>3) Keep track of scheduling your interview via the tracker (above) and upload to your files.</p>\r\n<p>4) Preparing for your interview:</p>\r\n<p>Before your first interview, watch our Interview Prep Video:</p>\r\n<p>Link: https://collegewise.com/interviews-video/</p>\r\n<p>Password: accepted</p>\r\n<p>Download and read through the document \"Common Interview Questions\" under your SENIOR ASSIGNMENTS folder</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Schedule a mock interview (if you&rsquo;d like) at least 1-2 weeks prior to your first interview. I&rsquo;ll have you do that with another counselor in the office (it&rsquo;s good for it to be with someone you haven&rsquo;t met yet), but let me know and I can assist in scheduling.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>",
